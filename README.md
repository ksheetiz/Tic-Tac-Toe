# Tic-Tac-Toe
#### PROBLEM STATEMENT (Tic-Tac-Toe)

Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3 Ã— 3 grid. The game may be started either by the X player or by the O player. The player who
succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. For example, Figure 1 shows a tic-tac-toe game where player O wins through a diagonal line. However,
it is not necessarily the case that every game has a winner (e.g., see Figure 2): when there is not a single free slot in the grid, and when neither player has managed to mark a winning row, then it is
called a tie. That is, a game is considered as over either when there is a winner , or when there is a tie .
